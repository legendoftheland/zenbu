# Zenbu
This is a WIP Discord bot. It is still in the **Alpha** stage.

## Upcoming Functions
A **Verification** command is in the works. Once completed, this command will be able to verify users in one of three ways:
- Email
- Reaction
- Captcha

The email verification system will also have the option of being set to only accept emails from a particular domain, making this useful for things such as company servers, where only members who have access to a company email account will be let in.
